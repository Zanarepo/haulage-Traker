Phase 1: The Foundation (Days 1–30)
Goal: Listen, Learn, and Map the Ecosystem.

Shadow the Users: Spend a day with a Collector on a route and another day at an Agent's outlet. Understand where the app fails them (e.g., "The IoT scale won't sync" or "The map is inaccurate").

Audit the Data: Dive into the product analytics (Mixpanel/Amplitude). Where are users dropping off? Is it the USSD registration or the KYC process for Agents?

Stakeholder Alignment: Meet with the Engineering and Operations teams to understand the current "Technical Debt" versus the "Feature Roadmap."

Phase 2: Optimization & Quick Wins (Days 31–60)
Goal: Improve Funnel Conversion & Trust.

Identify "Low-Hanging Fruit": If 40% of users drop off at the "Request Pickup" stage, I’ll run A/B tests to simplify that UI.

Enhance Trust Features: Improve the transparency of the Scrapays Wallet. Add clearer transaction histories or "Price Trend" notifications so users know why their scrap value changed.

Process Efficiency: Work with Ops to reduce the "Lead Time" between a pickup request and a Collector arriving. Can we automate the dispatch better?

Phase 3: Scaling & Innovation (Days 61–90)
Goal: Drive Growth and Strategic Advantage.

The "Agent" Growth Engine: Develop features that help Agents manage their business better—like "Inventory Alerts" (telling them when they have enough scrap to call a truck for evacuation).

Referral Loops: Implement a "Refer a Neighbor" program for Households (Producers) to increase organic growth without heavy ad spend.

Fintech Integration: Explore deeper financial products for Collectors, such as "Daily Health Insurance" or "Micro-loans" based on their collection history on the platform.

Final Interview Tip: The "Why Scrapays?" Answer
When they ask why you want to work there, use this "triple-threat" answer:

Impact: "I want to solve Nigeria’s waste problem at scale."

Tech Challenge: "I'm excited by the complexity of a four-sided marketplace involving IoT and USSD."

Economy: "I believe in the 'Waste-to-Wealth' mission—helping everyday Nigerians earn more in a tough economy."
