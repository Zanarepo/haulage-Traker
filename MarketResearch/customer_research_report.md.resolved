## 📩 TIER 1 EMAILS: Close Within 30 Days

### Email 1: IPT PowerTech (The #1 Target)

**To**: Head of Operations / VP of Managed Services  
**Subject**: You're losing ₦XX million/quarter in unverified fuel drops. Here's the fix.

---

Hi [Name],

I'll get straight to the point. Your teams refuel thousands of generator sites every month across Nigeria. But how do you verify that 100% of the fuel dispatched actually reaches each site?

Most managed service providers we've spoken to lose **10-15% of their fuel budget** to a combination of:
- Unverified drops at remote sites
- Manual reconciliation that takes weeks
- Field reports that can't be cross-checked in real time

We built **NexHaul** specifically for companies like IPT PowerTech.

**Here's what changes with Nexhaul:**
- **Every fuel drop is digitally verified** with tamper-proof delivery confirmation—no more unverified paper receipts.
- **Reconciliation happens in seconds**, not weeks. Your finance team gets period-based automated reports.
- **Work orders are digitally tracked**—you see exactly when a technician arrived at a site, what they did, and what parts they used.
- **Health alerts predict failures** before they trigger SLA penalties with IHS or Airtel.

I'm not asking for a meeting yet. I'm asking you to let us run a **30-day pilot on 50 of your sites**. We'll show you the exact gap between fuel dispatched and fuel delivered. If the number doesn't shock you, we'll walk away.

Can I send you a 3-minute product video?

### Email 2: Chokie Telecoms & Energy

**To**: Managing Director / Operations Manager  
**Subject**: One dashboard for all your telecom sites across Nigeria, Ghana & Chad

---

Hi [Name],

I came across Chokie Telecoms and was impressed by your "one-stop-shop" approach to managed telecom services across three countries. That kind of scale is exactly what NexHaul was built for.

Quick question: **how do your teams currently report maintenance completion at remote sites?**

If the answer involves WhatsApp photos, paper forms, or Excel spreadsheets, you're leaving yourself exposed to:
- Unverified field visits (engineers who "sign off" without completing the work)
- Asset histories scattered across 3 country offices
- Reactive maintenance that causes unnecessary client escalations

**NexHaul Maintain** gives you:
✅ Digital work orders with GPS-stamped proof of completion  
✅ A centralized asset health registry across Nigeria, Ghana, and Chad  
✅ Automated PM scheduling with health alerts—so your team fixes problems before your client notices them  

I'd love to show you a 15-minute live demo. Would Thursday or Friday work better?

### Email 3: NTS Nigeria Limited

**To**: Head of Site Operations / CTO  
**Subject**: You guarantee uptime for MTN and Airtel. What guarantees YOUR data?

---

Hi [Name],

NTS Nigeria guarantees uptime and performance for some of the biggest names in Nigerian telecom—MTN, Airtel, ATC. That's a massive responsibility.

But here's the question nobody asks: **what happens when a critical PM task gets missed, and you don't find out until the site goes down?**

We've seen it across the industry:
- Preventive maintenance "completed" on paper but not in reality
- Generator fuel levels dropping faster than they should
- Spare parts logged as "used" but never installed

**NexHaul** is the accountability layer between your field teams and your client SLAs:
- **Verified work orders**: Your field engineer checks in at the site, photos are GPS-stamped, and the task isn't marked complete until it's truly done.
- **Smart health alerts**: Our system flags anomalies (sudden fuel drops, overdue PMs) before they become outages.
- **Instant reporting**: When Airtel asks "what happened?"—you have a verified, timestamped digital trail.

Can I show you a quick demo? It'll take 15 minutes and could save you your next SLA penalty.

### Email 4: TSL Transport Services Limited

**To**: Fleet Manager / Operations Director  
**Subject**: Every liter you can't account for is stolen margin.

---

Hi [Name],

TSL moves bulk liquids and fuel across Nigeria. Your product literally *is* the fuel—which means every unaccounted liter is direct revenue lost.

Here's what we hear from companies in your space:
- "We know fuel is disappearing, but we can't prove where"
- "Reconciliation takes 2–3 weeks per period"
- "Our waybills get lost, altered, or arrive too late to be useful"

**NexHaul InfraSupply** was built for exactly this:
- **Digital Proof of Delivery** with secure verification at every drop point
- **Real-time tracking** so you know where every truck and every liter is, right now
- **Automated reconciliation** that mathces dispatched volume against received volume—instantly

We're offering a **21-day free trial**. No credit card, no commitment. Just plug it in and see the gap for yourself.

Interested?

### Email 5: GIG Logistics (GIGL)

**To**: VP of Operations / CTO  
**Subject**: GIG moves fast. Your reconciliation shouldn't hold you back.

---

Hi [Name],

GIG Logistics is one of the most tech-forward logistics companies in Nigeria. Your growth across West Africa is inspiring.

But growth creates a problem: **the more you deliver, the harder it becomes to reconcile.**

Every delayed waybill, every disputed delivery, every fuel report that doesn't add up—it's friction that slows you down.

**NexHaul InfraSupply** eliminates that friction:
- **Digital waybills** that can't be lost, forged, or delayed
- **Tamper-proof delivery verification** for every dispatch
- **Period-based automated reconciliation** that your finance team will love
- **Role-based access** so drivers, team leads, and management see only what they need

We built this for companies at your scale. I'd love to show your ops team what "instant reconciliation" looks like. Would a 20-minute demo work next week?

Best,  
**[Your Name]**

### Email 6: Red Star Express

**To**: Head of Fleet / National Operations Manager  
**Subject**: FedEx trusts you. Can you trust your fuel data?

---

Hi [Name],

Red Star Express has built a reputation for reliability—your FedEx partnership proves that. But reliability at scale requires visibility, and visibility requires data you can trust.

Quick audit question: **What percentage of your monthly fuel spend can you verify with certainty reached the vehicles that needed it?**

If that number is less than 95%, NexHaul can close the gap.

- **Every fuel transaction is digitally verified** and tied to a specific vehicle, driver, and route
- **Reconciliation is automated** by period, by team, by region
- **Your finance team gets clean data** instead of chasing paper trails

We're working with logistics companies across Nigeria to eliminate the "fuel question mark." I'd love to include Red Star in that conversation.

15 minutes for a demo?

### Email 7: Raeanna (2,500+ Sites)

**To**: Director of Operations  
**Subject**: 2,500 sites. 1 dashboard. Zero surprises.

---

Hi [Name],

Raeanna manages over 2,500 telecom sites in Nigeria. That's an incredible footprint—and an incredible maintenance challenge.

At that scale, the questions multiply:
- Which sites have overdue PMs?
- Which generators are consuming fuel faster than normal?
- Which field teams have actually completed their assigned work orders?

**NexHaul Maintain** answers all of these from a single dashboard:
✅ Automated PM scheduling across all 2,500 sites  
✅ GPS-verified work orders—proof your team was on-site  
✅ Smart health alerts that flag anomalies before they cause downtime  
✅ Centralized spare parts tracking  

You've built the infrastructure. Let us help you protect it. Free 21-day trial, 50-site pilot.

## 📩 TIER 3 EMAILS: Strategic (6+ Month Play)

### Email 8: IHS Towers (Via IPI PowerTech Channel)

> [!TIP]
> **Strategy**: Don't pitch IHS directly. Instead, position NexHaul as a tool that **IPI PowerTech uses** to deliver better service to IHS. Once IPI adopts it, IHS sees the data and asks for it directly.

**To IPI PowerTech (referencing IHS):**

> "When IHS reviews your quarterly SLA report, imagine including a dashboard showing: every site visited, every fuel drop verified, every PM completed on schedule. That's the report NexHaul generates automatically."

---

### Email 9: TotalEnergies Marketing Nigeria

**To**: National Logistics Manager  
**Subject**: 570 stations. How many deliveries can you fully verify?

---

Hi [Name],

TotalEnergies runs one of the most sophisticated distribution networks in Nigeria—570+ stations, multiple depots, and a fleet that never stops.

But between the depot and the pump, things go missing.

**NexHaul InfraSupply** gives your logistics team:
- Digital proof of delivery at every station
- Automated volume reconciliation (dispatched vs. received)  
- Real-time fleet visibility across all routes
- Role-based dashboards for depot managers, drivers, and regional leads

We understand that a company of your scale requires a thorough evaluation. We're happy to start with a **controlled pilot at 20 stations in Lagos** to prove the ROI before scaling.

Would your logistics team be open to a discovery call?

Best,  
**[Your Name]**
